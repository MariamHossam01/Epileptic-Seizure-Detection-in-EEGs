# Epileptic Seizure Detection in EEGs 


### Epileptic Seizure 

Epileptic seizures are a common neurological disorder characterized by sudden and excessive electrical discharges in the brain. 
These discharges can cause a variety of symptoms, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and sensory disturbances. 
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique that records the electrical activity of the brain and is widely used to diagnose epilepsy and monitor seizure activity. 
Automatic epileptic seizure detection (AESD) systems aim to detect seizures in real-time using EEG signals, which can provide timely intervention and improve patient care.

### Signal Processing Techniques 

A number of signal processing techniques have been developed to preprocess EEG signals and extract features that are relevant for seizure detection. These techniques include:

Filtering: Filtering is used to remove noise and artifacts from EEG signals.

Feature extraction: Feature extraction is used to extract features from EEG signals that are representative of the underlying brain activity. 
Common features include spectral features, time-domain features, and nonlinear features.

Segmentation: Segmentation is used to divide EEG signals into segments that are short enough to be analyzed for seizure detection.

### Learning Techniques

Machine learning techniques have been used to develop AESD systems that can automatically detect seizures from EEG signals. These techniques include:

Support vector machines (SVMs): SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used to classify EEG signals into seizure and non-seizure classes.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs): ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used to model the complex relationships between EEG features and seizure occurrence.
